    The "Restaurant Robot: Automated Serving System" project aims to revolutionize restaurant operations by introducing a reliable robot capable of serving food and carrying liquid items. The primary objectives include enhancing the efficiency of delivering drinks to customers' tables and assisting restaurant staff in transporting food items within the premises.
  </p>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The proposed project focuses on developing a stable and reliable robot for efficient food and liquid-based item service in a restaurant environment. The key emphasis is on automating the delivery process of drinks and providing support for carrying food items.
  </p>

  <h2>Problem Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The hotel industry faces challenges in optimizing the transportation of food and beverage items within restaurants. Manual delivery processes are often time-consuming and inefficient, leading to potential delays and decreased customer satisfaction. Our project addresses this issue by introducing an innovative solution to automate the delivery process of drinks and provide assistance in carrying food items.
  </p>

  <h2>Existing Solutions</h2>
  <p>
    Several existing projects have been developed for tasks similar to our proposed project, particularly in carrying food items. However, these solutions often lack the ability to carry liquids and beverages due to stability issues.
  </p>

  <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
  <p>
    The restaurant robot's device architecture includes a robotic platform, control system, and communication methods. The robotic platform consists of a control circuit, stable chassis, rubber-gripped wheels, and food compartments. The control system utilizes microcontrollers, motor drivers, high RPM motors with odometer encoders, and a suitable power supply. Communication methods include local network communication, swarm technology compatibility, and microcontroller-to-microcontroller communication (UART).
  </p>

  <h2>Research and Literature Review</h2>
  <p>
    The project draws inspiration from research such as Vo Nhu Thanh's work on a restaurant serving robot using a line-following approach and Faruk and Ivanov's exploration of the robotic restaurant experience among global travelers. These studies contribute valuable insights into practical and efficient applications of robotics in the hospitality sector.
